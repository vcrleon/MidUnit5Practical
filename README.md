# I was able to make the first call and set up the recycler view to display the info from the API. I couldn't get the info to display in the second activity though. I was only able to set up the recycler view. I ran out of time to try it, but I think I was supposed to pass the info with a putExtra and by making another call. I forget what I tried doing, and I got a nullpointer exception since I wasn't referencing which data to display in the SecondActivity. I also ran out of time to try making the call to refresh the recycler view when clicking the "Refresh" button. In short, the most challenging parts were trying to display the info in the second activity and time managment, since I couldn't give the Refresh button a shot bc I spent most of my time trying to figure out the SecondActivity.
